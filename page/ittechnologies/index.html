                <h3>What does it do?</h3>
                An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle than can sense its environment and is able to operate without human
                involvement. The vehicle does not require a human passenger to take control, nor does it need a human
                passenger to be inside the vehicle at all. An autonomous vehicle can do everything and go anywhere that
                an experienced human driver and a traditional car can. (What is an Autonomous Car? – How Self-Driving
                Cars Work | Synopsys, 2021)<br><br>

                The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) currently defines 6 levels of driving automation ranging from
                Level 0 (fully manual) to level 5 (fully autonomous). These have now been globally accepted as the
                standard for autonomous vehicle development.<br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Level 0: No autonomous functionality whatsoever, a traditional automobile operated exclusively
                        by a human.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Level 1: Most driving functions are handled by a human, but one specific function (such as
                        accelerating and decelerating with an adaptive cruise control system) is handled by the
                        automobile.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Level 2: The automobile assumes all basic tasks (acceleration, braking, steering) associated
                        with driving under some circumstances, but human intervention is required if the system
                        miscalculates, and the human driver must always monitor the vehicle and its surroundings and be
                        prepared to retake control.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Level 3: The automobile assumes all basic tasks associated with driving and monitors the vehicle
                        and its environment to respond to unplanned circumstances. Human involvement is theoretically
                        only required in case of an emergency scenario in which the vehicle fails to respond properly to
                        its environment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Level 4: The automobile assumes all driving tasks in specified environments (such as traffic
                        jams), but a human driver is still required, and the vehicle must be capable of parking itself
                        safely if the human driver is unable to retake control.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Level 5: Full automation with no human input required, the vehicle operates under its own
                        control and can travel anywhere at any time without human occupants.
                    </li>

                Autonomous cars rely on a wide array of sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, machine learning
                systems, and powerful processors to execute software. They can create and maintain a map of their
                surroundings based on a variety of sensors situated in different parts of the vehicle. Radar sensors can
                monitor the position of nearby vehicles. Video cameras can detect traffic lights, read road signs, track
                other vehicles, and look for pedestrians. Lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors can bounce pulses
                of light off the car’s surroundings to measure distances, detect road edges, and identify lane markings.
                Ultrasonic sensors in the wheels can detect curbs and other vehicles when parking.<br> <br>

                Innovative software can then process all these sensory inputs, plot a path, and send instructions to the
                car’s actuators, which control acceleration, braking, and steering. Hard-coded rules, obstacle avoidance
                algorithms, predictive modelling, and object recognition help the software follow traffic rules and
                navigate obstacles. (What is an Autonomous Car? – How Self-Driving Cars Work | Synopsys, 2021)<br><br>

                <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
                The advancement to a fully automated vehicle will not be a new or sudden concept, but more of a
                continuing process with plenty of trials and tests, accumulating crucial information that is still
                lacking. They will launch in different phases, varying with the level of autonomy. A level 5 fully
                autonomous vehicle will probably take another decade or so before they hit the roads. However, level 4
                autonomous cars will likely be seen moving on the roads within the next few years. (The Future of
                Autonomous Cars | May 2020, 2021). <br><br>

                The scenarios for convenience and quality of life improvements with the development of autonomous
                vehicles are almost limitless. You could send your children to school using the car, and it could return
                home. The elderly and the physically disabled would have the freedom and independence to go wherever
                they wanted. It could drop you off at a point and head to a detected vacant parking spot rather than you
                having to drive around looking for one. If someone perhaps forgot something at home, you could even send
                it to them using the car. (What is an Autonomous Car? – How Self-Driving Cars Work | Synopsys,
                2021).<br><br>

                Perhaps the most important benefit of autonomous vehicles would be the decrease in number of
                accidents.They can prevent human errors from happening as the system controls the vehicle. It leaves no
                opportunity for distraction, unlike humans who are prone to interruptions. It also uses complicated
                algorithms that determine the correct stopping distance between one vehicle to another. As autonomous
                vehicles replace manual vehicles on the road, inevitably this will remove the roles and responsibilities
                of humans in driving. This could impact the employment rate of services such as taxi drivers, truck
                drivers and pilots, as is similar for many other industries that face automation. (Advantages And
                Disadvantages Of Autonomous Car – Half Fast Chicago, 2021)<br><br>

                Autonomous vehicles could result in a significant reduction in traffic congestion and faster travel
                times. Autonomous cars could communicate with each other, as well as complex automated highway systems
                which could direct traffic and identify traffic problems early. As there are fewer accidents and less
                traffic congestion, there would be a significant drop in harmful emissions. According to Ohio
                University’s Future of Driving report, harmful emissions will be reduced by 60% after the advent of
                autonomous vehicles. (7 benefits of autonomous cars, 2021)<br> <br>

                <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
                Currently I have a Learners driving license, and I am progressing towards a full driving license. As I
                do not drive, I primarily use public transport such as the train as my main mode of transport, otherwise
                I would be a passenger in a car, with someone else driving. Although I do plan to drive myself sooner or
                later, autonomous vehicles would mostly likely become my primary mode of transport once it completes
                development. In the most likely scenario, autonomous vehicles will replace almost all manual vehicles,
                such as autonomous trains and buses. So even though I may still use public transport it would likely
                still be autonomous.<br><br>

                I would probably have my own personal autonomous vehicle, and the same would be for my family and
                friends. I would have a faster journey, and therefore save time that would have been spent travelling.
                Even in the vehicle, as I am no longer required to manually drive the car, I can spend the time during
                the journey for my own personal use, such as watching a film or doing some work.<br>

                <h3>What does it do?</h3>

                Cloud server are processing, interface, network and memory cloud are made with these components and also
                database and storage. Cloud is also operated by a computer operator. It has set of component types that
                are made for speed, productivity, security and reliability.<br><br>

                Cloud servers is an information storage that processes multiple virtual servers. That is set to process
                remotely through an online interface. Cloud has a security options to use and including, intrusion,
                anti-virus software and firewalls. Also, customization to process and customize different options. It
                has a feature to store large volumes of information that is need for the cloud and process intensive
                workloads. Cloud storage is an access to store and save files and data to the through the internet or on
                a private network. It helps to secure, host, maintain and manage the servers infrastructure and help
                with accessing data wherever it is needed. The storage and computer hard drive helps with cost efficient
                and scalable storage network and also to increase demand. Cloud storage is access through the internet
                network, website or portal and is helps with access the storage by any device. It has access to security
                through the cloud storage with up-to-date technology and practices and with secure infrastructure. It
                also gives the IT administrators the control over the data with viewing, storing, access and editing.
                It saves the files and folders through the hierarchical on the network and retains the data storage
                system where it is originated. You can store audio, video and other files so it can be retrieving and
                store data. The security of a data or cloud storage to access your data and files through security and
                authentication and data encryption. Back up data and storage is also important as security. Cloud
                storage is also defined by can host many servers and virtual servers and software so it can be easy to
                access. Cloud storage and services are also provided by the multiple IT administrator and Is also used
                to work together, sharing and file transfer by cloud storage services. As well as to ensure services to
                manage files and to files to be stored in a multiple storage and that is easy when needed to update or
                change. Cloud computing is a server or data storge to help others to find solutions to help to maintain
                and create to have easy access for many IT services and computer operators to help with reliability,
                performance, security, productivity, speed and cost.<br><br>

                Cloud storage has a range on many options to provide the IT administrator to networking, storage and
                process power and data that can be access through the cloud. These services are used by many providers
                and applications and software. It is also a self-server that is used by many IT administrator and others
                to access through a webpage or a web interface. It enables to process many data and workloads and store
                a large volume of information. Cloud servers are the access of information on a virtual infrastructure
                and to help application to process storage. The storage has control and security to those servers that
                is being process by the provider or IT operators and others. It is performed by cloud and virtual server
                that is perform by the internet and can be access anywhere that is required. Cloud services are
                delivered by the network, that is process by the internet by demanded operators and applications and
                network access and cloud-based servers. Cloud storge is a technology for transferring and storing data
                through the internet by multi servers and locations or a storage object that is s format for storing
                data to the cloud where it can be managed as an object that contains information, data and
                files.<br><br>

                <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
                Gives you more control for the backup. It is good for companies and organizations that needs their
                backup and control of the system. It is likely to impact on IT services and IT support. No need for
                additional hardware and easy to store and process backup and restore and use for computers access
                anywhere. It is a substantial to impact the cost of using the cloud and the cost by the provider and
                self-services and network access. It will have an impact on the internet access and to increase cloud
                requirements. Other access requirement that has an impact like loss of data and malicious attacks. It
                also has a impact on the internet connection, level of security, data loss and privacy, risk and network
                access. Impact of resources, cost and reliability and the need on computer resources that will affect
                the impact on IT services. Software resources that will need to process to store and backup of
                information data and files. It also has an impact on providing a broad range of benefits and the share
                of data and additional resources. The ease or performance, security and control that is ensured meet the
                demands. It can be access anywhere through the internet, and products, software and application that is
                required. It needs the internet to access the cloud servers, or some needs a subscription to have access
                to the servers this will have an impact on the IT services and others or working internet access to
                process the cloud. An internet access requires the update of the service, data or files. There are many
                different cloud servers and services that can we require on the internet and as well as the cost
                efficient of using the server and there are others that does not need cost to process and store data to
                retrieve and manage your data.<br><br>

                <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
                Cloud servers can affect with the cost of maintain the server, it is also helpful with meeting
                requirements for a particular IT service or manager. It could help for fast network that is used with
                cloud or servers and giving the IT service the flexibility that is used for IT services and computers.
                Easy access for computers. Could be consuming for buyers that need to pay using the servers or cloud
                servers. It could affect the operator by up-to-date cost and process of the servers that is needed by
                the IT service operator. It could be reliable, fast, affordable by some IT service or operators. It
                gives you the control of your data files to be stored and used anywhere by many server or servers that
                has internet access. The set of data and files access are the need of internet access without the
                internet the data files cannot be stored on cloud servers. This also has an impact on malicious
                software, data and remote locations. It also has effect on your software, hardware, storage and
                networking for the administrator to use the server. It is a part of IT servers to use the cloud to store
                and adjust and reliability of the use of data on everyday use for the IT serviced operators on the
                internet or servers. It is a process for information to be store and maintain by administrators to
                operate many multiple tasks that is done through the internet sources and servers and cloud servers. It
                also a risk of loss of data and security that is required by the IT operators. It is important to have a
                servers with information and data to store and maintain the use of information data and security
                passwords. These have effect on IT services and provider to have these requirements to process with
                operators that needs task to be process for sharing and to store. <br><br>

            <section>
                <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
                <i>Thomas Bradford</i><br><br>
                Today, every facet of our lives is governed by technology. For example, students now use technology
                almost exclusively to complete their schoolwork, a significant number of workplaces have transitioned to
                some form of work from home model and in the wake of the global pandemic, we now “check in” at most
                locations we attend. The result of that is that our personal and sensitive information is not only
                stored on our personal devices but is also stored on servers around the world due to cloud-based
                technology. <br><br>

                This kind of technological advancement has changed the way we live our lives. While it has many positive
                impacts, the transition to primarily online processes has resulted in a heightened threat to individuals
                and businesses’ information. Specifically, all this information is at significant risk of cyber threats,
                including the threat of:<br><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Cybercrime, which refers to single actors or groups targeting systems for financial gain or to
                        cause disruption;</li>
                    <li>
                        Cyber-attack, which generally involves politically motivated information gathering measures; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cyberterrorism, which is intended to undermine electronic systems to cause panic or fear in
                        society (Kaspersky Lab, 2021).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                The primary threat to everyday people and businesses is the threat of cybercrime. For instance, the
                threat of malware or “malicious software”, which is software developed by cybercriminals designed to
                cause damage to a server, computer, or network. A common example of malware is a “virus”, which is a
                program designed to attach itself to a friendly file. Once the file is on a computer, the virus operates
                to infect other files on the computer with malicious code. Another example of malware is a “Trojan”
                which is disguised as normal, legitimate software. Once uploaded onto a computer, a Trojan operates to
                cause damage and/or collect a user’s data. A further example is “phishing”, which is where a
                cybercriminal targets a victim via email. The email is designed to appear like it comes from a
                legitimate source with the intention being to trick the user into replying to the email with their
                sensitive information, for example, credit card details.<br><br>

                To combat the risk of malware, phishing, and other cyber-attacks, there has been an increased focus on
                cyber security. Kapersky Lab (2021, para. 1) defines cyber security as “the practice of defending
                computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's
                also known as information technology security or electronic information security”. The term applies to a
                variety of measures, including the protection of network, application, information, and operational
                security. Together, these facets of cyber security operate to detect and protect everything from
                personal devices, personal and sensitive information and data assets and computer networks secure from
                malicious attack. Cyber security operates on an individual level, but also operates to protect
                businesses and government entities (who hold a significant amount of individual information) from
                attack.<br><br>

                One of the biggest elements of cybersecurity is anti-malware software which is designed to detect,
                combat against, and remove things such as malware. Early anti-malware software utilised signature-based
                strategies to detect known viruses (Malwarebytes, n.d). However, this software was unable to detect new
                threats. As technology has advanced, anti-malware software has evolved with it. It is now able to detect
                new threats via the technology of “heuristic analysis”. By using heuristic analysis to analyse program
                structures and behaviour, these programs are now able to detect unusual code or activity rather than
                just detecting known viruses.<br><br>

                It is difficult to predict the future of cyber security because of the ever-changing behaviours of
                cybercriminals and the new attacks these criminals develop. For example, the number of global ransomware
                hacks increased by nearly 25% from 2018 to 2019, prompting cybersecurity developers and businesses to
                create innovative software to counter this trend (Parker, 2020). <br><br>

                It is impossible to tell what the next big threat or attack will be, but experts still have a good idea
                of the direction that we are headed in. Within the next three years, it is expected that Artificial
                Intelligence (AI) will become both a software vulnerable to attack, as well as a core component of all
                cyber security systems. AI will likely be embedded into user interfaces to warn users about high-risk
                websites and programs. Additionally, it may be used to simulate network attacks and identify weaknesses
                in existing cyber security measures.<br><br>

                We are seeing an increase in technology and the way we use it. The impact of this is that there is a
                heightened demand for solid and ever evolving cyber security, both for individuals and corporations. It
                is difficult to predict the impact of cyberattacks and cyber crime in the future. However, it is
                important as a society, we are alive to the risks of using technology to avoid cyberattacks and malware.
                <br><br>

                As the risk to information increases alongside our growing reliance on technology, we can expect to see
                the younger generation being educated on this a lot earlier than previous generations. As we are already
                starting to see, people will be taught about cybersecurity from a young age. There is not one group of
                people that will be impacted by the advancement of cybersecurity; this will have a global impact on any
                person utilising technology in future.<br><br>

                Data is rapidly becoming one of the most valuable assets in today’s society (Tunggal,2021) and the
                damage that can result from poor cybersecurity measures cannot be understated. It is estimated that in
                2020, over 12 billion records were compromised with known ransomware attacks, which represents a rise in
                attacks of nearly 60 per cent (Karen, 2021). Companies now hold the personal information of millions of
                people, and there is a growing risk that this information is vulnerable to cyber-attack. For example, in
                April 2019 almost 540 million records held by Facebook were breached and May 2019, the sensitive
                information of over 885 million users of the First American Financial Corporation were breached
                (Tunggal, 2021).<br><br>

                With the increase in such attacks and the corresponding need for cyber security, we are already seeing
                an expanding demand for IT professionals with a cyber security focus. It is expected that we will
                continue to see an upsurge in the demand for cyber security jobs within the next decade. This is
                reflected in the results of a 2017 study, which estimates that, by 2022, the gap between open positions
                and qualified personnel will widen to 1.8 million jobs (Frost and Sullivan, 2017).<br><br>

                The growth in the need for cyber security experts will directly impact me. This is because it is my
                intention to one day work in an IT role where cybersecurity knowledge is an essential requirement. It
                will also impact me in my daily life, as I will need to continue to ensure that I have appropriate
                software and knowledge to ensure that my personal information remains safe from cyberattack. Similarly,
                my family and friends will need to ensure that they are aware of the risk of cybercriminals, both in
                their personal lives and in their employment. This is particularly relevant for people who have
                transitioned into a work from home environment, where the business information is perhaps more
                vulnerable than ever.<br><br>

                As the risk to our personal information grows, so too does the need to ensure we have put in place
                appropriate measures to address such risks. As I am now aware of the various methods that cyber
                criminals may use to access information, I will be more cognisant in ensuring that my information is
                protected in the future.<br><br>

            <h1>Natural Language Processing and Chatterbots</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>
                <i>Jennifer Anne Muirhead</i><br><br>

                Language comes naturally for most people. A one year old baby may understand as many as fifty words, and
                be able to make one or two common, simple words like mama or dada (Lam-Cassettari, 2019). Computers have
                historically struggled with language, at most pretending to have a sort of pseudo understanding in very
                narrow fields (Pavlus, 2019). Natural Language Processing, NLP, is attempting to improve this. NLP is a
                branch of Artificial Intelligence that “gives machines the ability to read, understand and derive
                meaning from human languages” (Xue and Zhang, 2020).<br><br>

                NLP is the driving force behind various applications, many of which are used inconspicuously in
                day-to-day life. Gmail uses NLP both in front of and behind-the-scenes. The former through spell-check,
                and the latter through emails being filtered and classified as they “flow through the servers” -
                stopping spam in the process (Asokan, 2019). A more advanced use of NLP can be seen in the medical
                field, where it “enables the recognition and prediction of diseases based on electronic health records
                and a patient's own speech”. Cardiovascular disease, depression, and schizophrenia are all health
                conditions currently being explored by NLP (Tyag, 2020).<br><br>

                This is possible due to the vast improvements of NLP in recent years, that have come largely as a result
                of Neural Networks more generally, and Transformers more specifically (Anand, 2020). There are many
                types of Neural Networks, but generally, they are a form of machine learning, loosely based on the human
                brain, where a computer learns how to perform a task based on labelled training samples. A Neural
                Network may have thousands to millions of simple processing nodes, which are often layered and densely
                interconnected (Hardesty, 2017).<br><br>

                <div class="inTextImages">
                    <img src="/images/Figure1.PNG" alt="A simple deep learning architecture, n.d.">
                </div>

                Technological innovations led from a Feedforward model, which only sends data in one direction, to a
                Recurrent model, where connections between nodes form a directed graph, effectively gaining the ability
                to retain previously received information in short-term memory.<br><br>

                <div class="inTextImages">
                    <img src="/images/Figure2.PNG"
                        alt="Comparison of Recurrent Neural Network and Feed-Foward Neural Network, n.d.">
                </div>

                Although an improvement, RNNs are inherently deficient at retaining information over long periods of
                time. This is because of something known as the “vanishing gradient” problem in back-propagation (Kobran
                and Bayns, 2020), illustrated in
                figure XYZ.<br><br>

                <div class="inTextImages">
                    <img src="/images/Figure3.PNG"
                        alt="Illustration of vanishing gradient using Recurrent Neural Network, n.d.">
                </div>

                This is an issue in language, as we often re-refer to specific items later in a sentence, such as in the
                Griezmann example. Subsequently, the next innovation came from Long Short Term Memory, or LSTMs. LSTMs
                are a type of Recurrent Network able to determine key information, retain it over longer periods of
                time, and recall the information much later on in the sequence (Kobran and Bayns, 2020).<br><br>

                <div class="inTextImages">
                    <img src="/images/Figure4.PNG" alt="Example paragraph of Part-Of-Speech Tagging, n.d.">
                </div>

                Part-of-Speech Tagging, PST, is often used with LSTMs to retain information, such as the subject, verb,
                and object of a sentence. Although tagging doesn’t not solve any particular NLP problem, it is a
                prerequisite for simplifying and resolving a lot of different, more complex issues (Malhotra and
                Godayal, 2018). Current accuracy rates for POS tagging are in the 97 per cent (Ruder, n.d.). The
                downside of PST is that the data used must be labelled - manually tagged - which is time-intensive and
                causes problems with scalability (Wired, 2016).<br><br>

                <div class="inTextImages">
                    <img src="/images/Figure5.PNG" alt="Example sentence of Part-Of-Speech Tagging, n.d.">
                </div>

                These tools have helped to develop and improve the technology for speech recognition, language modeling,
                and translation, yet the current State of the Art framework is Google’s BERT, which stands for:
                Bi-Directional Encoder Representations Transformers (Anderson, 2019).<br><br>

                Unlike the others, BERT was bi-directionally trained on unlabeled text. It learned from understanding
                text cohesion from a large body of content in plain text - more than 2.5 billion words from English
                Wikipedia - followed by fine-tuning on smaller, more specific natural language tasks (Anderson, 2019).
                <br><br>

                Currently, BERT is being used at Google to optimize the interpretation of user search queries - a task
                possible due to BERT’s stellar natural language understanding and sequence-to-sequence based language
                generation (Nayak, 2019). BERT has advanced the NLP field in numerous ways, including: question
                answering, abstract summarization, sentence prediction, conversational response generation, polysemy and
                coreference resolution, word sense disambiguation, natural language inference, and sentiment
                classification (Lutkevich, 2020).<br><br>

                Which, although impressive, could also be the beginning of the end to many language-dependant jobs, like
                translation. In 2016, more than 100 billion words were translated each day by Google Translate alone
                (Turovsky, 2016). In many high-resource languages, like Spanish and Chinese, it has an accuracy rating
                of around 90%, and these figures have been improving over time (Caswell and Liang, 2020). It is
                conceivable that with the continued advancements in NLP technology, translation could become an obsolete
                profession. However, this may not happen for many years to come. Although high-resource languages have
                high accuracy rates, the inverse is true for low-resource languages like Farsi and Armenian, 67% and
                55%, respectively (Wetsman, 2021). <br> <br>

                Another promising way in which NLP is being used is in the act of summarisation. Summarisation is
                becoming an increasingly invaluable asset, as can be seen in the following example published in Fortune:
                “In 1995, the average daily reading requirement of a U.S. intelligence analyst was 20,000 words. By
                2016, the same analyst’s daily reading load was estimated at 200,000 words”. This number, Kahn writes,
                is more than a human can skim in a day. The phenomenon of insurmountable data is affecting other fields,
                too, like finance, law, and the sciences. The issue is that accurately summarizing long documents whilst
                retaining the useful information is difficult for humans, and somewhat subjective. Though there are
                companies who have developed summarisation tools based on BERT, that can generate reasonably fluent
                summaries (Kahn, 2020).<br><br>

                Despite, or perhaps because of these advancements, my daily life, just like the life of my friends and
                family members will likely be affected in many small ways, many of which we likely won’t even notice - a
                characteristic of good design. For me personally, I might see it in small things like Gmail correcting
                my misspelling of the word “necessary”, or the company chatterbots I’m fairly sure aren’t human, but I
                say “please” and “thank you” anyway just in case. But there are some larger ways in which our lives may
                change, too. Like the disappearing language-barrier, the control over (fake) news (de Oliveira et al.,
                2021), and whether we get picked for that job or not (Zaroor, Maree and Sabha, 2017).<br><br>

                Natural Language Processing tools like BERT are changing how humans analyze and connect with
                information. Computers are becoming more capable of comprehending content and performing human tasks. It
                is not unreasonable to predict that human jobs, especially those in language-dominated fields, will be
                made easier by these technological improvements, before eventually being replaced by them.<br><br>
