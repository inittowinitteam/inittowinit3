                My name is Jennifer, I’m Scottish-Australian, and I like solving puzzles. I have an odd amount of formal qualifications for an early twenty-something (hint: more than 5) and am beginning the trend anew with online courses. I got my start in programming with C through Harvard’s CS50 and am currently enrolled in RMIT studying Java (though edX and I still flirt occasionally). Never a language monogamist, I also speak a wee bit of Korean and Polish. Most importantly, I have a cat whose name is Chonky.

                <p>Student No. s3909589</p>
                <div class="slice"></div>
                My name is Jeremy and I live in a small town just outside of Warrnambool in the south-west region of 
                Victoria called Koroit. I work in a butcher shop. I usually deliver meat and make small goods. My life 
                revolves around fulfilling orders, making burgers, and linking sausages for a living, among other things. 
                Outside of work I usually stay home. I play PC games, usually of a competitive nature playing against 
                others, but a great story focused campaign is just as appealing; also, I try to visit my Dad, and my dogs 
                every Sunday. I am currently studying a few subjects through RMIT and I intend to eventually study the 
                Batchelor of Information Technology. I am an absolute tech-head as far as I know, I build computers, I code, 
                I argue that Android is superior, and I am usually the one who is called upon when somebody I know has an 
                IT issue.

                Hi, my name is Glenn, and I am a 21-year-old who is living in Melbourne. While both of my parents come from 
                China, I was born in Perth, Western Australia. Fortunately for me, this allowed me to become a native 
                speaker in English as well as have a good understanding of Mandarin. I enjoy watching various videos and 
                shows on YouTube and Netflix and to feed my pet dog Arrow food scraps from meals. When I was young, I was 
                always keen and enthusiastic to be able to use the computer, which back then we had to share. These 
                childhood experiences sparked my interest in all things IT related, and I have been invested ever since.

                <div class="slice"></div>
                Hi, I’m Tom Bradford and I am 32 years old. I have a background in the trade industry, I am a glazier by trade.
                I have been working with glass in high rise buildings from the age of 17. I also enlisted in the Royal Australian
                Regiment for five years from 2008 to 2013. During my enlistment, I was part of a couple operations with 8/9 RAR.
                I was deployed to East Timor and to Malaysia. I have not studied since I completed grade 11 in high school in 2006.
                More recently, I returned from a trip around Australia with my wife. We took a year off work to complete the lap with
                our 4WD and camper trailer. We had an absolute blast. My interest in IT is just the love of technology and how it
                helps us and entertains us in a way that just was not possible years ago. I cannot recall a particular event in my
                life that sparked my interest, I just know that I have always been intrigued by anything technology related. From a
                very young age I was always into my video games, remote control cars, computers and even playing snake 2 on my Nokia 3315. .

                My name is Roger Saythavy I am from Australia NSW Sydney, and I am studying a bachelor degree in IT because it is in my interest to 
                this course because I have qualifications in IT course before and very interest in finishing a degree in IT to get a career in this 
                field of IT because it is what I want to be in for my career. I also like IT in many ways from the units I done to build my career 
                in this field in IT.
