                <div class="slice"></div>
                My name is Jennifer, I’m Scottish-Australian, and I like solving puzzles. I have an odd amount of formal qualifications for an early twenty-something (hint: more than 5) and am beginning the trend anew with online courses. I got my start in programming with C through Harvard’s CS50 and am currently enrolled in RMIT studying Java (though edX and I still flirt occasionally). Never a language monogamist, I also speak a wee bit of Korean and Polish. Most importantly, I have a cat whose name is Chonky.

                <h2>Test One</h2>
                <div class="slice"></div>
                <div class="img-container">

                </div>
                Firstly, looking at the Myers-Briggs’ test, some of my positive characteristics are that I am, or at least can be, rational, informed, independent, determined, curious and versatile. I tend to seek out information, try to expand my knowledge, base my opinions on facts, as opposed to feelings, don’t rely on others, work hard to achieve my goals, explore new ideas, and am willing to try many things in order to do so.<br><br>
                For obvious reasons, these traits can be helpful when trying to complete a task, and as such have proved helpful in a work or school based setting. That is, of course, until they go unchecked and become the extreme, undesirable versions of themselves. Confidence becomes arrogance, independence becomes the inability to work with others, and flexiblity becomes lability. Because I tend to be evidence-based, if I find myself in a position where I am asked to do something without a good explanation of why, I can come off as combative and questioning of authority. 
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Test Two</h2>
                <div class="slice"></div>
                <img src="/images/JenniferVARKQuestionnaire.PNG">
                I didn’t find the VARK questionnaire particularly useful because my immediate thought with almost all questions was “well, it depends”. Then when I read the options, I selected all of them, most of the time. The questionnaire really struck me as a “would you like more information or less information?”, as opposed to “which information would you like?”<br>
                <br>For instance, when given the prompt:
                “When learning from the Internet I like: 
                <ul>
                    <li>videos showing how to do or make things.</li>
                    <li>audio channels where I can listen to podcasts or interviews.</li>
                    <li>interesting written descriptions, lists and explanations.</li>
                    <li>interesting design and visual features”</li>
                </ul>
                All I could think of is “well, it depends, but ‘yes’”.
                I also noticed that a lot of the questions were targeted at beginners, or people doing things forthe first time. I think a beginner, an intermediate, and an expert, would benefit from different types of explanations based on their experience level more so than their learning style. And this is without even mentioning that different topics can be explained better/easier with certain styles.

                <h2>Test Three</h2>
                <div class="slice"></div>
                <img src="/images/JenniferBigFivePersonalityResults.png">
                My Big Five personality score revealed that I’m slightly more introverted than I am extroverted, which I would agree with. Not necessarily because I don’t like socialising or that I’m not good at it, but I find it can be quite draining and it’s not where I get my energy from. I tend to socialise in small bouts, then go off on my own to recharge.<br><br>
                It also revealed that I’m a reasonably emotionally stable person who can handle stress and is slow to anger and other negative emotions.<br><br>
                The test believes I’m slightly more agreeable than disagreeable, which I would agree with in everyday life - I’m more than happy to go with what the other person wants for things like where we should eat, or what we should watch (things I consider mostly unimportant) - but not when it comes to important things, like work or assessments. In those cases, I think we should do what will result in the most desirable outcome, or most promising idea. Which, I can acknowledge, is not always mine, though I won’t easily acquiesce if I think mine is better.<br><br>
                I am a highly conscientious person who’s disciplined and well organised. I tend to implement structures, timelines, to-do lists, and other time and progress trackers to keep on top of my tasks. I like to produce good work on time.<br><br>
                I scored roughly 50/50 on intellect/Imagination, previously known as openness to experience which surprised me slightly. Though, if considered from the perspective that I neither seek out the traditional/the expected/the usual, or the new/the untested/the unusual, I would agree. I don’t inherently go for either extreme, despite being open to both of them. It depends entirely on the context and specific scenario.<br><br>

                My name is Jeremy and I live in a small town just outside of Warrnambool in the south-west region of 
                Victoria called Koroit. I work in a butcher shop. I usually deliver meat and make small goods. My life 
                revolves around fulfilling orders, making burgers, and linking sausages for a living, among other things. 
                Outside of work I usually stay home. I play PC games, usually of a competitive nature playing against 
                others, but a great story focused campaign is just as appealing; also, I try to visit my Dad, and my dogs 
                every Sunday. I am currently studying a few subjects through RMIT and I intend to eventually study the 
                Batchelor of Information Technology. I am an absolute tech-head as far as I know, I build computers, I code, 
                I argue that Android is superior, and I am usually the one who is called upon when somebody I know has an 
                IT issue.

                I have not written a lot about these tests because I honestly do not think too much of them. I do not 
                believe the results mean anything useful. You cannot develop a critical opinion about someone based upon 
                a generic online test.<br>
                
                <br>Furthermore, I would never consider these tests to find "appropriate team members" as so many others 
                do while gathering people for a project. If you really want to know somebody's personality you should 
                interact with that person for yourself and form your own opinion. <br>
              
                <br>The creativity test says that I am slightly below average when it comes to creative thinking. However, 
                it would not be wise for me to limit my involvement in creative team tasks. The same logic applies for a 
                high creativity score i.e. I should not jump in and take over a creative team task because "I'm better 
                according to a test I found on the internet". <br>
                <br>The point is, do not sell yourself short because a test says you are not good enough. But do not get a 
                big head either if the test goes in your favour. I personally would much rather work with someone who is 
                open minded and is prepared to consider the thoughts, ideas, and opinions of others even if their ideas 
                make more sense.

                Hi, my name is Glenn, and I am a 21-year-old who is living in Melbourne. While both of my parents come from 
                China, I was born in Perth, Western Australia. Fortunately for me, this allowed me to become a native 
                speaker in English as well as have a good understanding of Mandarin. I enjoy watching various videos and 
                shows on YouTube and Netflix and to feed my pet dog Arrow food scraps from meals. When I was young, I was 
                always keen and enthusiastic to be able to use the computer, which back then we had to share. These 
                childhood experiences sparked my interest in all things IT related, and I have been invested ever since.

                Although it is interesting to look at my results from the various tests, it is important to keep in mind 
                they should not be taken too critically. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test was possibly the most in 
                depth, or at least it certainly asked the most questions. I liked that the result had a comprehensive 
                explanation for my personality ‘type’, and it felt the most relatable. The learning styles test result did 
                not quite seem to fit me, as for many of the questions there were not any answers that I would normally 
                choose, and I would simply pick the one that was closest. The Big Five Personalities test did not have as 
                much of a detailed explanation for their results which did make it a little hard to fully understand the 
                result’s significance.<br>
                
                <br>The results of these tests may influence my behaviour in a team by making me more aware of my 
                capabilities and personality traits, and be more supportive, reliable and hardworking. It might impact my 
                behaviour by making me support my team members and as I try to move towards a frictionless environment, 
                striving to avoid conflict. It could also influence my reliability as I try to make sure not to miss anything 
                that needs to be done, as well as meet my own standards with good, hard work.<br>
              
                <br>When forming a team something to consider is that my tendency to support and aversion to conflict can 
                be taken advantage of by another member of the team, who may constantly ask for help when they do not feel 
                like working hard. This, along with a sense of self-duty can combine to create a situation where I become 
                overloaded. Another possibility to take into consideration is that my behaviour could help create a 
                supportive environment and a close-knit team, where team members can have confidence in each other’s 
                dependability.

                Hi, I’m Tom Bradford and I am 32 years old. I have a background in the trade industry, I am a glazier by trade.
                I have been working with glass in high rise buildings from the age of 17. I also enlisted in the Royal Australian
                Regiment for five years from 2008 to 2013. During my enlistment, I was part of a couple operations with 8/9 RAR.
                I was deployed to East Timor and to Malaysia. I have not studied since I completed grade 11 in high school in 2006.
                More recently, I returned from a trip around Australia with my wife. We took a year off work to complete the lap with
                our 4WD and camper trailer. We had an absolute blast. My interest in IT is just the love of technology and how it
                helps us and entertains us in a way that just was not possible years ago. I cannot recall a particular event in my
                life that sparked my interest, I just know that I have always been intrigued by anything technology related. From a
                very young age I was always into my video games, remote control cars, computers and even playing snake 2 on my Nokia 3315. .

                <h2> Myers-Briggs Test</h2>
                <div class="slice"></div>
                <img src="/images/thomas/myers-briggs.png">
                I have recently undertaken a number of tests that may be used by employers during a recruitment process. The tests
                provided certain insights into my personality and learning style. A brief summary of the results of each test is detailed below. 
                Myers-Briggs Test After completing the Myers Briggs test, I got ESFJ-A or “Consul”(16 Personalities, 2011-2021). The Myers Briggs
                results were very detailed and included information about how my personality type’s strengths and weaknesses and approach to
                relationships and my career. Broadly, the test results reflect that Consuls are popular people, who enjoy being in the spotlight
                and leading others. People with a Consul personality take responsibility seriously and will base their moral compass on established
                traditions and law. Consuls enjoy participating in discussion, respect hierarchy and are loyal partners and employees. 
                I feel that the result of Consul is an accurate representation of my personality. I do enjoy being of service and consider myself
                supportive and outgoing. I have the personality type to be a good leader and I am good at managing several projects at one time. 
                The results provide a detailed list of strengths and weaknesses, which I believe will influence my behaviour in a team environment.
                As a positive, I have strong practical skills to offer a team, I am loyal and good at connecting with others. However, I am also
                inflexible at times, vulnerable to criticism and reluctant to innovate. These weaknesses obviously have the capacity to
                adversely impact those around me and have a negative influence on my team. By knowing my weaknesses, it will place me in
                a better position to recognise when I am displaying negative behaviours and work to address these in future. 
                In terms of how this will influence forming a team, I believe it is important to assemble a team of people who
                complement each other. Where I have an identified weakness, it is important to have others within a team that
                have a strength in that area.

                <h2>My Learning Style  </h2>
                <div class="slice"></div>
                In addition to the Myer’s Briggs test, I also took a test to assess my learning style (EducationPlanner, 2020). The results
                reflect that I am 40% auditory, 40% visual and 20% tactile, meaning that I am an Auditory/Visual Learner and learn through
                a combination of listening and looking. The test provided several tips to assist with auditory learning, including use of
                flashcards, reading information out loud and recording myself. As I am also a visual learner, the test recommended visualising
                things as I hear them, writing down key instructions and drawing pictures to explain new concepts.  
                My learning style requires both audio and visual prompts. Now that I am aware of this, I can ensure that I utilise the
                recommendations to ensure I am absorbing information as best I can. Through ensuring I am implementing best practice in my
                studies, I can ensure I am making the best possible contribution to my team. This will also influence how I form a team as
                I consider it would be beneficial if all team members had similar learning styles.

                <h2>Integrity Test</h2>
                <div class="slice"></div>
                <img src="/images/thomas/integrity-test.png">
                For the third test that you might be required to complete at a job interview, I completed an integrity test. (PsychologyToday, 2021).
                I completed this test as I believe that honesty and integrity are qualities that all employers will think highly of.  
                I received an honesty outlook of 78/100. For me, I think that this is a good result and reflects that I am trustworthy. I think
                that integrity is an important part of any team because you have to be able to trust your teammates. The test is indicative of
                the fact that people who are inclined to time theft and cyberloafing may be more inclined to take part in dishonest behaviours.
                If I observed these behaviours in a person, I would be less likely to consider including that person when forming a team.
