                <p>For this section, I (Jeremy Bouchier) decided to interview an IT professional who works at my company. His name is Lachlan Hayward.</p>
                <br>
<p>
    <b>Jeremy:</b> <i>“Alright Lachie, introduce yourself…“</i>
    <br>
    <b>Lachlan:</b> <i>“My Name is Lachlan Hayward; I work at Midfield Meat International in their IT Department.</i>
</p>
<br>
<p><h3>What kind of work is done by the IT Professional?</h3></p>
In Lachlan’s words: <i>“Most of my work and focus is on the IT and betterment of Midfield”.</i> Lachlan is employed by Midfield Meat International and is responsible for all IT systems in use by the company and sub-companies beneath it. Meat Processing, Dairy Processing, Livestock Tracking and Handling, Data and Logistics, and helping people send an email are just some of the tasks Lachlan is involved with daily. Lachlan describes himself as “on-call” whenever people need him, but always has his hands full regardless.
More broadly, it is Lachlan’s job to know when a machine, computer or a piece of data is either about to malfunction or is not as expected. By the time a core system is starting to give trouble, Lachlan is already fixing it.
<br>
<br>
Each sub-company is in a different state; however, long distance does not exempt Lachlan from working on-site.
<br>
<br>
<b>Jeremy:</b> <i>“You said you support all of the Midfield Companies, not just the Abattoir… Companies everywhere.”</i>
<br>
<b>Lachlan:</b> <i>Lachlan: “UDC Milk is located in Penola, we’ve got UDC Trading… located in Brisbane, there’s Midfield Meat International which is located in Warrnambool and there is Lowlands Pastoral – farms located between Victoria and South Australia.”</i>
<br>
<br>
Other than the main site in Warrnambool, Lachlan is frequently travelling to Penola in particular. Normally that would be a 4-hour round trip via car, however, a helicopter is utilised to get Lachlan on/off site quickly.
<br>
<br>
There is a lot of data to handle within the Midfield Group of companies. Employee records, security surveillance, client/customer accounts and records, maintenance records, transport logistics… The list just keeps going on with seemingly no end. All this data is stored within a central System called ‘iLeader’ that Lachlan personally oversees, usually on his own. Furthermore, Lachlan being the main overseer, is usually the person who has to assist everyone with issues related to iLeader. He is always busy.
<br>
<br>
<h3>What kind of people does the IT Professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</h3>
Lachlan must interact with his IT co-workers, as well as anyone requiring his IT assistance throughout every level of the company. Furthermore, some sections of Midfields digital footprint are outsourced, which means Lachlan must collaborate with various other IT professionals outside of his company.
A simple example of this is Midfield’s main website. It is hosted off-site, but still receives updates and maintenance from both the hosting company and first party Midfield staff.

<br>
<br>
<h3>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h3>
Lachlan spends most of his time at Midfield Meat International’s Warrnambool plant. He lives only a few kilometres away from his work, and his spare time is usually spent on designing improvements to Midfield.

<br>
<br>
<h3>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>
Lachlan describes the notion of not immediately knowing the solution to a problem can be a challenge. After all, it his job to know the IT systems of the company inside and out. He feels like he is letting people down when cannot provide answers.
