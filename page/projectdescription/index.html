            <section>
                Our group was serendipitously made up of a bunch of various geeks, nerds, and other nondescript technophiles who share one important commonality: a multi-year (and in some cases, multi-decade) long obsession with video games. From classics like Super Mario Bros., indie games like Limbo, giant triple A games like Assassin's Creed and everything in between, video games are something we all felt made an impact on our lives. Although nowadays we all have different specialties and interests in IT, we all started our forays into technology through video games. Whether it was Battletoads on NES, Zelda: Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64, or even online games like Survival Project: Search for the Legendary Orb, we all feel as if we have a connection to video games. Therefore, despite numerous good ideas to choose from that all would’ve made valid and interesting projects, we elected to make a game.
                <br><br>
                We chose this project based more so on passion, interest and nostalgia than technical skill. Although some members of our group have made games before, mainly whilst they were younger or in high school, we have very little combined experience in game development. This is especially true considering we are using a specific game engine for this project, one which most of our members hadn’t even heard about before. We knew going into this project, there would be a steep learning curve, but were willing to make that sacrifice and take that risk in order to work on a project we felt personally interested in.

            <section>
                Nowadays, there is far more to video games than just finding, buying and playing a title. Over the years, a community has evolved on streaming sites like Twitch that relies not on physical proximity, but a shared love of gaming and a desire to connect with likeminded people. So much so that streaming has become an integral part of the gaming community and has been for many years now. And ‘community’ is the operative word, as in many ways, streaming is a very social activity. From the streamer answering direct questions from viewers, to hosting another streamer once their stream has ended, to the in-jokes that permeate the community site-wide, as well as those that are streamer and game specific, communication and interaction are a foundational aspect of streaming.  
                <br><br>
                What’s more, it’s begun to skyrocket in popularity, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. The logic behind this is not complicated: more people were at home and had nothing to do.   
                <br><br>
                In 2019 Q1, viewers spent a total of 2.8 billion hours watching Twitch. In 2020 Q1, it was 3.2 billion hours. Now, in 2021, Q1, viewers spent a staggering 6.3 billion hours watching Twitch (Edwards, 2021). This is a rise of 97% in just one year.  
                <br><br>
                And Twitch is powerful, too. It’s been known to bring back ‘dead’ games, like Rust. OfflineTV, an online social entertainment group of streamers, created a Rust server, OTV and Friends, in December 2020. The server was created with the distinct purpose of being “a place for content creators and streamers to produce content for their respective channels” (OTVWiki, 2020). Shortly after, with Rust’s popularity beginning to resurge, other popular streamers, like Shroud, xQc and TimTheTatman began playing the game. By January 2021, Rust, which had not even been in the top-ten best-selling games, shot to number four, dethroning Cyberpunk 2077 in the process (Carroll, 2021). 
                <br><br>
                Not only can Twitch revive dead games, but it can also champion new ones, too. At least for short periods of time. The most recent example of this was the cultural phenomenon Among Us. Among us is a 2018 online social dedication game that began gaining popularity in July 2020. Peaking in early November with 775k views, it has since levelled off to around 11k (TwitchTracker, 2021). Despite its short-lived popularity, it amassed more than 570k reviews on the Apple app store, 480k on Steam, and 11.8m on the Google Play store, with average ratings of 4.2/5, 9/10, 3.5/5, respectively.  
                <br><br>
                Being picked up by a popular streamer is the goal of any indie studio, as it almost guarantees a spike in popularity and purchases. In IT to win It is no different, and as we recognise the value and importance of making a good impression on streamers, we foresee this influencing our future marketing decisions and advertising campaigns.

                In our project we elected to develop a side scroller 2D platformer game. We wanted it to be quite difficult to complete, despite it having such a simple concept: getting from point A to point. Part of the difficulty comes from point B being locked unless the user can find all the keys around the map. The keys will be in visible but hard-to-reach places where the user will have to cross lava or spikes to reach them. The intention is that the user will be required to utilise both skill and good timing to reach the keys and the finish point of each level.
                <br><br>
                Ultimately, given the time frame available to us, the team elected to develop one level for the project. To achieve this, we nominated individual roles to complete each week, including level design, coding, and developing sound effects. After the first level is completed, we plan to add more levels, and with it, new challenges and enemies. From there we would try to develop boss battles which take place between levels.

            <section>
                As a team, making a game and all the processes involved in it, is something that we are all interested in doing and passionate about. This is the primary motivating factor in choosing to do this for our project. Our main project aim is to be fun for the user, which if achieved, may open up the possibility for monetisation in the future. We will attempt to achieve this aim through well-developed and interesting gameplay, story and aesthetics. It is important that our project is appealing to its potential audience so that the game gets positive reviews, and good word-of-mouth that can raise the number of sales. 
                <br><br>
                Currently the gaming industry is the highest valued of all entertainment industries. The global gaming market stood at about US$159.3 billion at the end of 2020, with a projected annual growth rate of 12% for the next several years (Deyan, 2021). Although there is plenty of money in the gaming industry, our project will need to stand out as there is plenty of competition, particularly from the major titles and gaming studios. In the future, the knowledge and experience we gain from this project, developing a game and all the processes along the way, can be valuable for each member of the team that looks for employment somewhere in the IT industry. Particularly this project would show to a future employer our teamwork, and ability to communicate effectively.

            <h1>Aims</h1>
            <section>
                The player of our game has exactly one aim: escape the king’s castle. To homage a famous, albeit toxic (at times) game, League of Legends: You don’t win by having the most kills, you don’t win by having the most cs, you don’t win by destroying the most towers. The only way you win, is by destroying the enemy Nexus. We’ve taken a similar approach to this with The Last Knight. In our game, you don’t win by killing a certain amount of enemy NPCs, or evading a certain amount of projectiles, you win simply by getting through the final door. Of course, there are many challenges the user will have to face along the way. One of these is that the user will be required to collect keys. This decision was made to add another element of difficulty to the game, and to force the user to take a more methodological approach, as opposed to just running directly from A to B. League of Legends and The Last Knight are not similar in many ways, but an important commonality that they both share is that they are strategy-reliant games, which is often overlooked because there are enemies to be killed. By having the exclusive aim of The Last Knight being to “escape the king’s castle”, we hope to remind users to think strategically when considering obstacles and enemies.  
                <br><br>
                In order to complete this aim, the player will need to achieve a number of goals. These goals can be broadly oversimplified into movement and not-movement related. Firstly, the movement. Users will need to become familiar with the movement mechanics in this game: left, right, up, and down. They are simple, but crucial. Secondly, the non-movement. Users will also need to practice their timing and patience, mainly to avoid harmful interactions. For instance, waiting for the archer to release their arrow, waiting for the slime to make their leap, and waiting for the spikes to withdraw back into the ground are all examples of times the player will practice non-movement. Switching between these two states will be paramount in overcoming obstacles and evading death in this game. Other goals, such as collecting keys, will come as a result of alternating between these two states. Although it sounds easy, it will take time for the user to master when to move and when not to move. They will need to consider things like gravity, speed, position, height, and accuracy continually. One way to help users become more aware of these states is by the use of achievements. Although they are not currently a part of our game - a deliberate choice made after considering scope creep - we intend to explore the idea of implementing them in future updates in an effort to instill good habits in users early on.

            <h1>Plans and Progress</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>The Story</h2>
                <br><br>
                Our project is a PC-based single-player 2D platformer. It is of the “side-scroller” subgenre. 
                <br><br>
                The story follows Eques, a knight who was stripped of his valour by the king after failing to save his daughter in a raid. Distraught, the king has ordered Eques to pay the ultimate price and is currently being held in the castle’s dungeon, awaiting execution. Eques, believing the daughter’s death does not lie on his conscience, has decided to escape. The user plays as Eques and is tasked with evading numerous hostile enemies and terrain if he is to gain his freedom. 
                <br><br>
                <h2>The Elements</h2>
                <br><br>
                The first of this terrain is the simple, floating platform. It has no spikes, and it cannot damage the player unless they fall off and into lava. There is no fall damage in this game, aside from a sea of lava at the ground’s lowest level. 
                <br><br>
                Next, the user will face spiked terrain. The first set of spikes is stationary, and simply needs to be jumped. The difficulty of this task comes from the precision needed to jump the spikes. Throughout the game, they are differently spaced, and often the user is only given a one or two block clearance before they hit the next set of spikes. This was done purposefully to add a layer of difficulty to the game and force the user to use excellent timing and precision. Later on in the game, there are spikes which retract into the ground, and depending on the surrounding terrain, cannot be jumped. This was done to challenge the user’s perceptions and strategy skills. Neither the stationary nor retractable spikes kill the user on first contact, like the lava, instead, they damage them. If the user and the spikes make contact, the user will lose one heart. The user starts with three hearts, and when they lose all three, they die. 
                <br><br>
                The next threat that the user will face is the slime. Slimes are an enemy NPC that moves side-to-side in a defined area. Once again, the user will not die by touching the spikes, they will simply lose a life. At the beginning, the user will only face one slime at a time, typically in a wide area for the slime to move. This is an easier mechanic for the user to navigate and was done so to get them familiar with this mob before increasing the difficulty later, when two or even three slimes are introduced.
                <br><br>
                The next terrain they will be introduced to is the moving platform. There are two types of these: horizontal and vertical. The vertical platforms, sometimes called ‘elevators’ go up and down between two set distances. The user isn’t informed about these distances, and as such must be patient (or employ trial and error) to determine where they start and stop. For instance, the first elevator is simple, it starts at the same height as a stationary platform, making it easy for the user to step onto. Then, it rises to the level of the next platform, making it easy for the user to step onto. Once again, this simple version of the mechanic was done to introduce the concept of elevators to the user. After this, they typically involve impending collisions with damaging terrain, like spikes. 
                <br><br>
                After this, the next new enemy they will face is one of the king’s archers. The archer has been stationed in the dungeon to guard the escape key. This is one of the most technical parts of the first level to navigate, as there is a mix of various enemies and terrain that must be navigated. The archer’s fighting style is, unsurprisingly, ranged. They stand still on a ledge to the right of an elevator shaft. The elevator floats directly across the path of the archer. The user first sees this platform from very low on the map, and the platform is on a downward trajectory, towards the lava. Unexpecting users will simply jump on the platform, before waiting to see if the platform touches the lava, as this is the first time a platform touching lava has occurred in the game so far. If the user waits, they will see the platform delve into the lava, before reversing its trajectory and going up, towards the archer. Done correctly, the user will now be standing on the platform, heading upwards, towards the archer on the right, and a slime on the left. The platform on which the slime is on is very short, and as such, the slime will be changing direction constantly. This is the same platform the user will need to cross in order to get the key. Assuming they get the key, the next step will be to return to the elevator platform going up to reach the next section of the game. 
                <br><br>
                <h2>The Journey</h2>
                <br><br>
                At the start of this project, we didn’t have a single tangible asset, despite attempting to make one last assignment. In assignment two, we were under the impression that, alongside the report we produced, we would also need a game that has clearly had some development done to it. We did not think that a fully fleshed out game had to be completed, but we thought we had to produce something. As a result, our first attempt was rushed, poorly formed, badly designed, and uninteresting. 
                <br><br>
                Day one of assignment three, we decided to scrap it entirely and come up with a new design. This was far easier to do because we had dedicated meeting time to discuss what the game would be, how it would look, feel, and play. This is opposed to the last assignment where it was just one of our members on game design, and everyone else was on report-writing duty. Unsurprisingly, the original game did not fare well. Ignoring the disappointment we felt that we had lost time and resources in assignment two, we were optimistic about how we could proceed given a new slate. 
                <br><br>
                The original game idea was not particularly developed except for the 2D platformer aspect. 
                <br><br>
                We had the most basic bare-bones objective: get from A to B, but the rest was undefined. At the start, there was no theme, story, enemies, obstacles or specific mechanics (besides left, right, and jump). Over the weeks and months, we’ve been able to create a full-fledged story and game, but this required a lot of back-and-forth, debate, and discussions.
                <br><br>
                Admittedly, we went about game development the wrong way. We did not start with a story that would have guided our decisions, instead, we built aspects of the game individually as they occurred to us. No clearer is this evident than our knight, who was, for most of the development, actually a white Tic Tac, affectionately dubbed “the bean”. 
                <br><br>
                The game we created was hobbled together through various game elements that we either wanted or thought a platformer should have. For instance, we knew that, as a platformer, we’d need terrain the user would have to maneuver and obstacles they’d have to avoid. This was obvious, as it is almost definitionally what a platformer is. We knew that we wanted some sort of damaging/death mechanic, as well as an extra layer of difficulty that wasn’t terrain/enemy based. We also knew that it’d be easier to make a game ‘inside a box’, so to speak. All of this, slowly over time, became our game. 
                <br><br>
                We developed platforms, both moving and stationary, to let our user explore the map. We developed both damaging and deathly obstacles, as well as enemies. The two enemies we chose came after a debate on “What kind of enemies should we have, ranged or melee?” To which we decided, both. The specific types of enemies, slimes and archers, were inspired by the game Terraria, which was much loved amongst all of the development team. The decision to hold our game in a dungeon was an evolution of an early idea to have it in a medieval setting but inside of a ‘box’. The dungeon was the perfect opportunity to add another layer of complexity: the key. This introduced an objective into each level and the story began to develop around it. 
                <br><br>
                At this point, we had the concept of adding a dungeon, archers, lava, and a key to our game but no cohesive element to tie it together. At this point, we began contemplating how we’d present our game to others, and we realised we needed an actual story, something that’d make our game unique and act as our unique selling point. Eques, the banished knight was born. 
                <br><br>
                We wrote the story of Eques for the A5 presentation. We wrote of how he was a King’s knight who failed to protect the princess, set to be executed for his crimes. Suddenly, this explained why he was in the dungeon, and why he was so determined to find the key to escape. After the team agreed to Eques, the dishonoured knight story, we acquired our assets from the Unity store - a knight, an archer, a slime, and a key. Up until this point, although we had decided on them in theory, no sprite assets had been acquired. 
                <br><br>
                Things became easier from here, and other parts of the assignment began falling into place. 
                <br><br>
                We began creating the world in Unity, ensuring the layout was correct and placing enemies in the pre-planned areas. Here, we ran into an issue: placing an enemy was easy, getting them to function was not. We had assumed that the person in charge of arts would simply place the assets, attach the scripts, and it’d be done. We were wrong. Although we did not make the artist write the scripts, we had not anticipated the technological expertise required to attach them. This then halted the testing phase, as whether the user could reach a platform, especially those that involved moving objects, could not be known until a proper playthrough was completed. We resolved the issue by having a meeting between the art and scripting team, but it was an unexpected delay which we did not account for. It was also another task put on the scripting team’s plate, which was not expected and caused undue stress.  
                <br><br>
                <h2>The Future</h2>
                <br><br>
                Despite the strange start, non-linear progression and various setbacks, by the end of the project’s deadline, we had created a fully functioning game with a developed background and cohesive story. We have set up the foundations of art, music, and scripting, which will make any future progress on this game far more manageable. Adding new levels, provided they do not introduce new enemies, is simply a matter of time availability, as opposed to breaking new ground or developing new processes. As a result, if another team were to take over this project, they could expedite new level creation, and expand the game rapidly. Although the original team may not be a part of the project any longer, we have discussed in our Time Frame the possibility of adding in boss battles between further levels. This, we see, as the game’s natural progression. These needn’t necessarily be large, fictional monsters (though the groundwork for these has been laid in the fictional slime enemy) but could require a complex series of movements from the user as they evade the arrows from a squad of archers.

            <h1>Roles</h1>
            <section>
                At the beginning of the project, we did not define distinct roles. In the first meeting, we came together to read through the assessment task sheet. We had also done this individually but chose to do it again as a team to ensure we were on the same page. In the first meeting, Jennifer read the brief aloud, then summarised the main points afterwards. We determined what was new for this assignment and set our first tasks with a soft deadline of “the following meeting”. These were noted in the meeting minutes. Before the next meeting, Jennifer planned an agenda based on the previous meeting. During the next meeting, we went around the virtual room, discussing what we had done, what went well, and what we were unable to do. If we completed our task, we were given a new one. If we did not complete our task, our deadline was extended, and depending on timing, we may or may not have been given a new task. This was the rough pattern we followed for each meeting from then on out.  
                <br><br>
                After a while, some of us fell into our natural niches. For Jeremy, this was Game Development. He had experience in Unity, C# coding, and was the most technologically component. For Jennifer, it was project management and writing. She was organised, attentive to detail, and had professional writing and editing experience which allowed her to write quickly. For Glenn, it was research-based writing. He was a talented writer and skilled at finding relevant and accurate expert sources. For Roger, it was being prepared to do repetitive tasks, like game testing - things that were necessary, but not glamorous. Thomas was slightly different in that his greatest skill was readiness to contribute to the team, regardless of the task. Despite having no experience in either video editing, or sound and music development, Thomas volunteered for these tasks when no one else would. This saved us on numerous occasions.
                <br><br>
                As a result of these natural attributes, we subsequently assigned the following roles for each of us:  
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>

            <h1>Scope and Limits</h1>
            <section>
                As a group, we decided quite early on to limit the scope of our project to something we could reasonably accomplish considering our lack of budget and short timeframe. This was honestly fairly easy to do, as it was a fresh project, and it was all hypothetical. Unfortunately, what we came up with was horrifically boring and was roughly akin to “A 2D platformer where you go from A to B”. Only later, when the actual coding began, did we realise our game had no substance. We then realised we wanted to work on a project we could reasonably accomplish and be proud of. The scope we came up with is as follows: A 2D platformer that features one playable character, who will traverse a single level. It will use the Life System, allowing the player three attempts at the level before they need to restart. The level will feature two types of enemies: one melee and one ranged. There will be both stationary and moving environmental objects and hazards. The melee enemy will move, the ranged enemy will not. No enemies will target the player - they will have set paths that they follow. Players can stand on platforms, but they cannot jump through them in either direction. Players will lose a life if they touch an enemy or environmental hazard. Keys will be used exclusively to unlock doors. If a key is touched by the player, it will be theirs.  
                <br><br>
                We decided to focus on a single level in this project to act as a proof of concept. There was some debate about this, with a series of pros and cons on each side. We eventually all agreed that we’d prefer to make one well-developed, fun, functional level than a couple of under-developed ones. We also discussed the possibility of using a damage system, as opposed to a life system, but opted for the latter as it was reminiscent of one of our inspiration games - Super Mario Bros. This then brought up the talking point of how about having more than one character, but because of budget and time constraints, as well as from a narrative perspective, we thought that having one single character would help the user feel more of an emotional connection to the knight specifically and the game in general.

            <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
            <section>
                To create the Last Knight, we needed tools and technologies for game and music development. For game development, we used the Unity Engine (v2021.1.5f1), Unity Hub (v2.4.3), and the Unity Asset store. The latter is where we acquired the third-party sprites and background used in our game - all of which fall under the Standard Unity Asset Store EULA and as such are able to be freely used in our game - commercial or otherwise. For the sprites we weren’t able to acquire from third parties, we designed in-house using Adobe Photoshop 2021 (v22.3.1). For music, we only used one program: Audacity (v.3.0.2). This is where we made all of the sounds used in-game, from footsteps, to lava, to the knight dying. 
                <br><br>
                For experience, Glenn and Jeremy had previously worked with Unity, Jennifer and Jeremy had experience in Photoshop, and no one had experience in Audacity. Though notably, the majority of this experience was from personal passion-projects and high-school assignments, so it was a learning experience for everyone involved.

            <h1>Testing</h1>
            <section>
                As we are making a game, testing will inevitably involve playing the game. However, this will not just be a singular play-through of the finished project, instead, it will be a continual process throughout the development stage. Not only this, but it will also require the testers to play the game ‘naturally’, as if they were genuine customers trying to finish it, as well as ‘bug hunters’, who are actively looking for problems that need to be fixed. For the latter, considering common issues such as:  
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Crashing, when a game freezes or closes;   
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Game play defects, when a particular feature is not acting as intended;   
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Collison, when the physics of two objects have connection issues; 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Graphics, when the images/sprites are corrupted or files are missing;   
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Text, when words are missing, misspelled, or extend past its intended area; and   
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sound, when the incorrect sound is played for the character/location or is missing entirely.     
                    </li>
                </ul>
                (TestBytes, 2017)
                <br><br>
                For our game specifically, testing may come in the form of ensuring coin mechanics are functioning properly. Although it may sound simple, this process has multiple steps that include verifying: the user can reach the coin, when the coin and the user’s character touch, the coin disappears from the screen, the user’s coin count increases by one, the graphics reflect the user’s coin count correctly, and the coin does/does not reappear as desired. These are just a few examples of one specific game mechanic - and it is something that will be tested by multiple testers, at various stages of development. 
                <br><br>
                At first, this will simply be done by people on the development team. The initial testing will likely occur by the person writing the code, whilst they are in the process of writing said code. This acts as a method of ensuring the product is working as intended, and as inevitable debugging when it is not. After this, testing will be passed onto other team members, who will follow a checklist to determine what mechanics are and are not working. This feedback will then be returned to the development team, who will revise accordingly. After the in-team testing, a far larger scale test of members from the general public will take place. Who, with the same checklist, will play through the game, creating a detailed report of what does and does not work.  
                <br><br>
                Most of these individuals will be from the game’s target demographic, but there will be a variety of people to create a more representative sample of secondary and tertiary markets. Ideally, testers will have a variety of skill levels, once again, to reflect the average user base. Because this is an indie game not produced by a AAA company, there will be no in house Quality Assurance team or testers. Instead, testers will be outsourced through a mix of cheap labour-hire firms, and volunteers. These volunteers may come from universities, Reddit, friends and family of project members, and gaming-enthusiast clubs. No specific qualifications will be needed by testers, and a variety of skill-levels are desired, but as it can be time-consuming to sort, organise, and integrate data, members of the prime target markets will be prioritised. Numbers could conservatively range from five to twenty-five, depending on the quality and depth of the reports from each individual.

        <section class="section page" id="risks">
            <h1>Risks</h1>
            <section>
                One of the most prominent risks for us specifically is the culmination of three facts: One, we are developing a game. Two, most of us have little to no experience making a game. And three, we have a short deadline. This is exacerbated by the fact that, not only have most of us not developed a game before, we also have not used the game engine we’re utilising for this project. So, not only is it a new concept, but it is also a new tool, too. Naturally, this will make the project more time-consuming, have a steeper learning curve, and thus, be riskier to undertake.  
                <br><br>
                Teams made of members who are experienced in game design and game creation, can dedicate most of their time almost exclusively to the hands-on development of their game. Although our team will attempt to be as hands-on as possible, we will almost certainly be required to divide our time between learning through video and text-based tutorials, shadowing a more experienced developer, and regular trial and error. We will likely have more bugs in our code, and less experience in how to fix them. Because of these reasons, we have taken on quite a risky endeavour.  
                <br><br>
                However, there are benefits that come as a result of us taking on something so novel. Firstly, to the benefit of the team, we will gain invaluable knowledge and experience working on a ‘real’ project. But secondly, and perhaps more importantly for the quality and longevity of the game, we do not possess as many bad-practices or ingrained foibles in our code that come as a result of a ‘this is how I’ve always done it’ mentality. Effectively, we are, as a whole, a ‘blank slate’. That is not to say that past experience or being in a field for many months or years is bad, we notably have some members with varying degrees of past experience in game development ourselves, but it is simply to note there is an upside to having a new perspective. 
                <br><br>
                Having a mix of these members - new and seasoned - we have decided to divide labour based on strengths. Those with more experience have elected to take on the more challenging and time-consuming aspects of game design, whilst those with less experience have been delegated important tasks tailored to their level. Utilising this method allows everyone to contribute to game development, whilst ensuring we meet our deadlines and mitigate the inherent risk we have taken on as a part of this project.

        <section class="section page" id="groupprocessesandcommunications">
            <h1>Group Processes and Communications</h1>
            <section>
                Communication is notoriously difficult, not only in school and work projects, but in day-to-day life. It is also, fortunately or not, an integral aspect of school, work, and day-to-day life. Fully acknowledging this, we as a team decided to enact a few guidelines to help ensure effective and consistent communication. We decided early on to communicate exclusively through one platform: Microsoft Teams. The reasoning behind choosing MT was twofold: One, it allowed us to have a centralised hub where we could contact each other. And two, it kept a record of said contact. There were of course other more granular reasons why we chose MT - it showed user availability, message time stamps, read receipts, it allowed personal and group messaging, the ability to react to messages, the ability to upload and store files, and to host and record meetings - but these are all, in a way, subsets of reasons one and two. The importance was not so much placed on which platform we chose, it was on everyone agreeing to use the same one. Microsoft Teams facilitated this one-platform experience, allowing us to meet both internal and external communication requirements. 
                <br><br>
                Having the platform was the first step. Next our group set up dedicated, regular meeting times. For us, it was Thursday evening and Sunday noon. We held these meetings twice weekly for the entirety of our project’s duration. This was the minimum. When the occasion called for it, we also held emergency meetings for unexpected or timely issues, and additional meetings prior to deadlines. This was in addition to our text-based communication, which despite having no minimum or maximum requirements, was utilised multiple times per week, with each member contributing to varying levels, at varying times, for varying reasons. 
                <br><br>
                When a specific team member’s input was needed, they were “atted”, or “@ed”. This technique was used as it sends a notification to the individual’s phone or desktop which, when clicked, links directly to that place in the conversation, highlighting their name in red text. This helped to minimize non-responses from people and prevented us from having to escalate issues with non-communication/contribution.  
                <br><br>
                In a previous assignment, though on the same project, we had an issue with a team member not contributing. We followed the proper protocols of contacting a tutor and explaining the situation. Although the student was not removed from the group, his non-participation was acknowledged, and he did not receive credit for the work he did not contribute to. If a similar scenario were to happen again, we attempt to follow-up with the tutor re: the team member’s absence.

                Covering both extremes of the best and worst case scenarios, there is also one more case we need to consider. If there were a student who did attend some meetings, but not all, did some work, but not much, we would attempt to communicate with them as a team in a non-hostile way, coming from an empathetic place but emphasizing that work still needs to be done by each of us. We would then work collaboratively with that team member to work out a plan that fits their capability and availability.

                Although it is subjective, if that student seems to genuinely want to help and contribute but is finding it difficult to attend meetings or meet deadlines but is keeping the team informed about their status and progress, this will be noted positively in our reflection section. We acknowledge that there are factors, such as mental health, family, and work requirements, that can impact a person’s ability to contribute to the project, and these should not be ignored, but identified and considered as a team. Alternatively, if the team member does not seem to want to contribute and does not keep the team informed, this will be noted negatively in the reflection section.
