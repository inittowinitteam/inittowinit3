            <h1>Our Passions, Interests and Skills</h1>
            <section>
                Our group was serendipitously made up of a bunch of various geeks, nerds, and other nondescript technophiles who share one important commonality: a multi-year (and in some cases, multi-decade) long obsession with video games. From classics like Super Mario Bros., indie games like Limbo, giant triple A games like Assassin's Creed and everything in between, video games are something we all felt made an impact on our lives. Although nowadays we all have different specialties and interests in IT, we all started our forays into technology through video games. Whether it was Battletoads on NES, Zelda: Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64, or even online games like Survival Project: Search for the Legendary Orb, we all feel as if we have a connection to video games. Therefore, despite numerous good ideas to choose from that all would’ve made valid and interesting projects, we elected to make a game.
                <br><br>
                We chose this project based more so on passion, interest and nostalgia than technical skill. Although some members of our group have made games before, mainly whilst they were younger or in high school, we have very little combined experience in game development. This is especially true considering we are using a specific game engine for this project, one which most of our members hadn’t even heard about before. We knew going into this project, there would be a steep learning curve, but were willing to make that sacrifice and take that risk in order to work on a project we felt personally interested in.
