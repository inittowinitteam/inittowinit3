                Our group was serendipitously made up of a bunch of various geeks, nerds, and other nondescript technophiles who share one important commonality: a multi-year (and in some cases, multi-decade) long obsession with video games. From classics like Super Mario Bros., indie games like Limbo, giant triple A games like Assassin's Creed and everything in between, video games are something we all felt made an impact on our lives. Although nowadays we all have different specialties and interests in IT, we all started our forays into technology through video games. Whether it was Battletoads on NES, Zelda: Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64, or even online games like Survival Project: Search for the Legendary Orb, we all feel as if we have a connection to video games. Therefore, despite numerous good ideas to choose from that all would’ve made valid and interesting projects, we elected to make a game.
                <br><br>
                We chose this project based more so on passion, interest and nostalgia than technical skill. Although some members of our group have made games before, mainly whilst they were younger or in high school, we have very little combined experience in game development. This is especially true considering we are using a specific game engine for this project, one which most of our members hadn’t even heard about before. We knew going into this project, there would be a steep learning curve, but were willing to make that sacrifice and take that risk in order to work on a project we felt personally interested in.

            <section>
                Nowadays, there is far more to video games than just finding, buying and playing a title. Over the years, a community has evolved on streaming sites like Twitch that relies not on physical proximity, but a shared love of gaming and a desire to connect with likeminded people. So much so that streaming has become an integral part of the gaming community and has been for many years now. And ‘community’ is the operative word, as in many ways, streaming is a very social activity. From the streamer answering direct questions from viewers, to hosting another streamer once their stream has ended, to the in-jokes that permeate the community site-wide, as well as those that are streamer and game specific, communication and interaction are a foundational aspect of streaming.  
                <br><br>
                What’s more, it’s begun to skyrocket in popularity, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. The logic behind this is not complicated: more people were at home and had nothing to do.   
                <br><br>
                In 2019 Q1, viewers spent a total of 2.8 billion hours watching Twitch. In 2020 Q1, it was 3.2 billion hours. Now, in 2021, Q1, viewers spent a staggering 6.3 billion hours watching Twitch (Edwards, 2021). This is a rise of 97% in just one year.  
                <br><br>
                And Twitch is powerful, too. It’s been known to bring back ‘dead’ games, like Rust. OfflineTV, an online social entertainment group of streamers, created a Rust server, OTV and Friends, in December 2020. The server was created with the distinct purpose of being “a place for content creators and streamers to produce content for their respective channels” (OTVWiki, 2020). Shortly after, with Rust’s popularity beginning to resurge, other popular streamers, like Shroud, xQc and TimTheTatman began playing the game. By January 2021, Rust, which had not even been in the top-ten best-selling games, shot to number four, dethroning Cyberpunk 2077 in the process (Carroll, 2021). 
                <br><br>
                Not only can Twitch revive dead games, but it can also champion new ones, too. At least for short periods of time. The most recent example of this was the cultural phenomenon Among Us. Among us is a 2018 online social dedication game that began gaining popularity in July 2020. Peaking in early November with 775k views, it has since levelled off to around 11k (TwitchTracker, 2021). Despite its short-lived popularity, it amassed more than 570k reviews on the Apple app store, 480k on Steam, and 11.8m on the Google Play store, with average ratings of 4.2/5, 9/10, 3.5/5, respectively.  
                <br><br>
                Being picked up by a popular streamer is the goal of any indie studio, as it almost guarantees a spike in popularity and purchases. In IT to win It is no different, and as we recognise the value and importance of making a good impression on streamers, we foresee this influencing our future marketing decisions and advertising campaigns.

                In our project we elected to develop a side scroller 2D platformer game. We wanted it to be quite difficult to complete, despite it having such a simple concept: getting from point A to point. Part of the difficulty comes from point B being locked unless the user can find all the keys around the map. The keys will be in visible but hard-to-reach places where the user will have to cross lava or spikes to reach them. The intention is that the user will be required to utilise both skill and good timing to reach the keys and the finish point of each level.
                <br><br>
                Ultimately, given the time frame available to us, the team elected to develop one level for the project. To achieve this, we nominated individual roles to complete each week, including level design, coding, and developing sound effects. After the first level is completed, we plan to add more levels, and with it, new challenges and enemies. From there we would try to develop boss battles which take place between levels.

            <section>
                As a team, making a game and all the processes involved in it, is something that we are all interested in doing and passionate about. This is the primary motivating factor in choosing to do this for our project. Our main project aim is to be fun for the user, which if achieved, may open up the possibility for monetisation in the future. We will attempt to achieve this aim through well-developed and interesting gameplay, story and aesthetics. It is important that our project is appealing to its potential audience so that the game gets positive reviews, and good word-of-mouth that can raise the number of sales. 
                <br><br>
                Currently the gaming industry is the highest valued of all entertainment industries. The global gaming market stood at about US$159.3 billion at the end of 2020, with a projected annual growth rate of 12% for the next several years (Deyan, 2021). Although there is plenty of money in the gaming industry, our project will need to stand out as there is plenty of competition, particularly from the major titles and gaming studios. In the future, the knowledge and experience we gain from this project, developing a game and all the processes along the way, can be valuable for each member of the team that looks for employment somewhere in the IT industry. Particularly this project would show to a future employer our teamwork, and ability to communicate effectively.
