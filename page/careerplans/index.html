            <section>

                In our team, each group member had a different “ideal job”, though some were similar in nature.   <br><br>
                
                Three of five of the ideal jobs are ’hands on’, technical roles including Jennifer’s ideal job, C++ Developer, Jeremy’s ideal job, Software Engineer (graphics), and Glenn’s ideal job, Software Engineer in test. All three of the technical jobs involve a variant of C - either C, C#, or C++.  <br><br>
                
                While these jobs are all similar, each involves a different subset of skills. Jennifer’s ideal role involves the design and development of software solutions and systems, whereas Jeremy’s ideal role involves the development of integrated graphics and visual effects for software applications. Glenn’s role is more focused on the development of tools and frameworks to test software and identify and fix issues.    <br><br>
                
                Roger’s ideal career is as an IT Specialist, where he will oversee “implementation, monitoring, and maintenance of IT systems” (FieldFinder, n.d.) more broadly. Roger’s role differs from the above roles because while the above roles are hands on and require development of code, Roger’s role requires oversight and troubleshooting of IT issues as and when they arise. It is expected that such issues will not specifically relate to development, but rather, a broader spectrum of all the IT industry.   <br><br>
                
                Thomas chose IT Manager as his ideal career, which is a role more managerial in nature, responsible for oversight to an IT Department (which ultimately may include oversight of some of the roles other group members have selected). However, it is expected that a person in the role of IT Manager would have in-depth knowledge of all aspects of the IT department he is responsible for managing.  <br><br>
                
                Although each of the roles has some unique qualities, a common element each role shares is that they are all based on the skills and information found in fields like Information Technology, Software Engineering, Computer Science. A primary theme across each “ideal job” is that the role will likely require completion of an IT degree and significant knowledge of various IT programs.
