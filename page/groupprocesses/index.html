            <section>
                Our group worked well together in assignment two. We maintained communication throughout the project with bi-weekly meetings that were roughly structured, using agendas. When the meetings took place, they were recorded in three separate ways: visually, audibly, and textually. We then stored the recordings in Microsoft Teams - our communication hub for this project. <br><br>
        
                Each meeting, we discussed what we had achieved since the previous meeting, what went wrong, what wasn’t able to be finished, and what needed to be done next. We read the assignment brief together, and divvied up the work equitably, considering each member’s strengths and weaknesses. We also imposed on ourselves “soft-deadlines”, which were entirely internal and used to give us more granular control over milestones and timelines. <br><br>
        
                Outside of meetings, each member of the group took personal responsibility to complete their assigned tasks on time and to a high standard. After the work was completed, each of us uploaded our work to Microsoft Teams, which allowed for open analyses and critique. Finally, we would update the team through MT’s chat function on what we had done. <br><br>
        
                Although our meetings were good content-wise, one consistent thing we struggled with was ensuring they were recorded. On numerous occasions, we forgot to record the meeting until the meeting was more than halfway through, or just prior to finishing. Although we would do our best to recap what had been discussed so far, forgetting to record our meetings made it hard to use specific details from that day’s discussions in our report.  <br><br>
        
                This recording issue was perhaps the most consistent, annoying, and yet fixable issue we had as a group. We feel as though we enacted strong checks and balances in assignment 2, yet somehow, the recording of meetings was not held to the same level of scrutiny. Because of this, introducing a new meeting-specific organisational checklist is one of our highest priority concerns for assignment 3. We will run through this checklist at the start of every meeting to help mitigate the likelihood of this happening again.     <br><br>
