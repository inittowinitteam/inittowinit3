                Overall, the GitHub logs can be useful at times for giving a rough idea of who did what, in relation to the website and game production. However, they can be misleading and should not be taken as the only evidence of division of labour. For instance, even if someone contributed most of the copy on the website, if they weren’t the one to commit it, this would not be reflected in the logs. It is important to recognise this can marginalise work that isn’t attached to a name, like writing.<br><br>

                We can see both types of misrepresentation in our project with Glenn. He was the person who uploaded the new report to the website, but was only a quarter of the writing team, alongside Jennifer, Thomas, and Roger. He was thus over-represented in the GitHub logs. However, as our writing is uncredited (to give a better sense of uniformity and cohesion), it is unclear as to who did what, and to what extent. Notably, Glenn wrote some of the more research-heavy sections of writing, which were more technical, time-consuming, and required proper citations. Subsequently, he was under-represented in the writing section.  <br><br>

                One example of how the GitHub logs were accurate were with Jeremy, whose role in this assignment was to handle the Unity-base development - the scripts. As a result, he is heavily, but accurately, represented in the GitHub logs. However, he did not contribute to any of the written work on the project. The inverse is true for Roger, who contributed to the writing, but not to the game. As we have noted above, since writing is not recorded but the GitHub logs are, it appears Roger did not contribute to the project at all, which is inaccurate. <br><br>

                Jennifer and Thomas contributed to both the game and to the writing. For the former, Jennifer contributed the art and Thomas contributed the sound and music. Moreover, Jennifer was primarily responsible for the organisation and planning of tasks and meetings, whilst Thomas was the sole video editor for our presentation. Despite filling these various roles, the only work that is reflected in the GitHub logs is the game-specific work they committed themselves. <br><br>
                
                We believe that the GitHub logs aren’t reflective of the project as a whole, but can be useful as evidence for certain tasks, particularly if they take place over a long period of time. It would be unfair to discard the logs completely, as they were reflective of Jeremy’s work on the game, but they did little to highlight the contributions of the other members.
