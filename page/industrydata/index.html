                    As a group, considering how diverse our ideal jobs are, we would realistically need each of the top 25
                        Generic Skills listed by Burning Glass. Skills like communication, organisation, collaboration, planning,
                        and presentation ability, will be required by everyone, despite, or perhaps because of their positions.
                        Especially when working with, or for, other people. For instance, even if an employee were to just do
                        programming, they would still need to update their team about their progress during meetings. They would
                        still need to work to a deadline and plan accordingly. They may need to coordinate and communicate with
                        other programmers or departments about specific details of the project. And finally, they may need to
                        present their work to the team when itâ€™s finished. <br><br>
                
                        One could make the argument that some of the top 25 skills are more profession-specific, such as
                        problem-solving and trouble-shooting, being more related to developers. Though in many ways, someone in a
                        managerial position will use these skills as well, just in different forms. The same could be said in
                        reverse for building effective relationships and being articulate. Although at first thought, one might
                        associate these skills with someone in a people-facing, managerial role, they can also be seen when working
                        with other developers/engineers. This may happen when two equally ranked developers have differing opinions
                        on a topic, and each need to state their opinions eloquently and persuasively.
