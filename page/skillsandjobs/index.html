            <section>
            For our project, we created a 2D platformer using Unity. Our game is quite short - only one level - and has been designed as a Proof of Concept. To complete a speed run of the game in its current state would only take a couple minutes. Our goal is to develop the game further, adding multiple different levels and introducing new, more difficult enemies. This would include introducing boss battles between each level. After the game has been developed completely, we expect it to require several hours of consistent gameplay to finish. To get to this stage, if I was given the opportunity to be the project manager of a team of four people, I would hire a designer, an artist, a programmer, and a producer (Stallion Gaming, 2021)

            <h3>Project Manager</h3>
            To start with, I would be the project manager. As project manager I would be overseeing the project and overall development of the game. I would be monitoring the team, making sure that the relationships and communication between all the team members are working smoothly, as well as diffusing any possible team conflicts. I would also be trying to anticipate any potential problems that we might encounter and plan accordingly. Perhaps most importantly, I would be managing the schedules and milestones for the team and ensuring that we meet our deadlines.

            <h3>Designer</h3>
            The designer would be responsible for the setting and storyline of the game, such as the characters and how the plot evolves throughout the game. Currently, the game only has a simple theme. They would establish concepts such as level difficulty and obstacles of the game.

            <h3>Artist</h3>
            The artist would be responsible for developing the art of the game. Although there is already an established foundation, in that many art and assets have been created, there is still an enormous potential for the game to be fleshed out and be more visually appealing, complex, and immersive. The artist would attempt to translate the designer’s concepts into in-game artifacts, whilst creating a unique and distinct style. This will be crucial in setting the game apart from others.

            One of the most important roles to fill would be the game programmer.
